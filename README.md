Project Title: Automated Model Ensemble Techniques for Improved Accuracy
1. Overview
This project focuses on building automated model ensemble systems that combine multiple machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy. It uses stacking, voting, and bagging techniques with automated pipelines to tune and select the best models.
The project applies these techniques to breast cancer classification, providing a Streamlit web app for interactive exploration and custom predictions.

2. Features
Ensemble methods: Voting Classifier (soft voting) and Stacking Classifier.

Base models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes.

Automated hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Model persistence using Pickle.

Accuracy results saved in JSON.

Streamlit app for visualization, dataset predictions, and custom input predictions.

Visualizations include accuracy comparison, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

CSV download of prediction results.
